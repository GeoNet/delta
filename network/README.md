### CHECKS ###

Pre-commit checks will be made on these files to ensure:

* No duplicated marks - these need to be globally unique
* No duplicated monuments - these will have a new _Mark_ code if rebuilt
* That all monument types are valid
* No duplicated networks - these need to be globally unique
* No duplicated stations - these need to be globally unique
* No duplicated sites - these need to be unique at each station

### NOTES ###

Dates should be given as in _ISO 8601_ (i.e. `2016-09-18T02:24:26Z`), future dates should be given in the form: `9999-01-01T00:00:00Z`.
