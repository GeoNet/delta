## Wellington historical station(s) Information ##
_"Wellington station" is a historical nomenclature which has been used to refer to three different locations which have recorded seismic activity in Wellington (sometimes all under the site code WEL, which will now only refer to the currently used site at the Dominion Observatory), which have been assigned the following station names, codes and descriptions:_

#### Station history ####
    * Start date of the Wellington station 1884 observation
   
    * A seismograph built in Wellington, New Zealand, for James Hector was operated at the Colonial Museum from 1884 to 1902

    * Start of "permanent"  station location for WEL 1915 Dominion Observatory" (1915/1916 - 9999).

    * Previous to 1915/1916 "station location(s) "
	-Colonial Observatory in Bolton Street" : Hector seismograph 1884? to 1902/1907?
   	-Hogben's House: 1897/1899 to 1915/16

####  Recordings and Instrumentation  ####

	* Seismographic recordings started in New Zealand with the installation of Milne seismographs at Wellington in 1900 and Christchurch in 1901.
	* The Wellington instrument was replaced in 1923 by a Milne-Shaw instrument which remained in operation for about 40 year.
	* Wood-Anderson seismographs were first installed at Wellington and Christchurch in 1931 (NB ~until 1960s when likely replaced by some Willmore seismographs).

   **Instrument assumed starting date:**
   - 1884-1902/1907 Hector seismograph
   - 1900-1922 Milne Seismograh
   - 1923- ~1963 Milne-Shaw Seismograh
   - 1931- ~1960 Wood-Anderson
   - ~1960- ~late 1970 Willmore instrument etc ..

#### WEL station as digitally referenced @Geonet ####
   First "digitally preserved " pick is from May 1931(https://service.geonet.org.nz/fdsnws/event/1/query?eventid=2178236)
   NB: This Pick seems therefore to relate to a "newly" installed Wood-Anderson seismometer

   _Two seismographs are installed in New Zealand; they are Milne horizontal pendulums with photographic registration. One is installed at the Hector Observatory, Kelburn, Wellington, under the charge of Mr. C. E. Adams, D.Sc, F.R.A.S., and the other at the Magnetic Observatory, Christchurch, under the charge of Mr. H. F. Skey, B.Sc.
   An improved type of seismograph—the Milne-Shaw—is under order for the Hector Observatory: the instrument is magnetically damped, and is very much more sensitive than the ordinary type of Milne seismograph.
   The records of these stations are sent to the General Secretary of the Seismological Committee of the British Association, to the Station Centrale Sismologique, Strasbourg, France, and to the principal observatories of the world, and thus form part of the general system of earthquake-observation being conducted throughout the world for the last thirty years.
The Hector Observatory (Dominion, aka WEL) appears to have been built in 1907, replacing the "Colonial Observatory in Bolton Street" ... (wikipedia)._

New Zealand's first seismograph: The Hector seismograph, 1884–1902 R. M. Young , J. H. Ansell & M. A. Hurst
   _A seismograph built in Wellington, New Zealand, for James Hector was operated
   at the Colonial Museum from 1884 to 1902. It was the first working seismograph
   in New Zealand, and one of the earliest continuously operated seismographs in
   the world. No trace of the instrument has yet been found, and the details of its
   construction are sketchy, but the story of its installation and regular use is contained
   in newspaper reports of the day._
   _The Hector seismograph was eventually superseded by two of the new seismographs
   devised by Milne. The purchase of the two Milne seismographs in 1897 was officially
   recorded in the form of a Parliamentary Vote for £140 (Anon., 1897), and represented
   the culmination often years of agitation by leading scientists (especially by George Hogben,
   the Secretary of the Seismological Committee of the Australasian Association for the
   Advancement of Science) for Government help in acquiring the new seismic recorders._
