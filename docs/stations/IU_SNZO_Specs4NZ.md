## General Information 

**Station Information SNZO** - Location: South Karori, Wellington, New-Zealand

Present in Delta GeoNet  station management as an Auxilliary station in mainland NZ

Foreign Agency ownership: Network Affiliation: IRIS/USGS - GSN (US) 
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7914/SN/IU
  
**Context/history**
- Seismic station from the Global Seismic Network (GSN) (United States)
Started in 1975 by the Seismic Research Observatory 
Used for global seismology

- 24 August 2024: SNZO station and streams are in part set
for being an auxilliary seismic station for NZ monitoring.

SNZO streams (NZ settings) are used as any continuous real-time station from the NZ National Network 

**Equipement** 

As used by Geonet (2024):
  - Broadband Borehole Velocimeter
  - Broadband Borehole Accelerometer
  
Other instruments are not described in Delta. (e.g. BB, VBB and barometers) 

## Detailed Information 

### Data
- **IU SNZO stream settings for IU**
Meant for global survey - Has low Real-time stream sampling (weak and strong) and barometers

- **IU SNZO stream settings for NZ, GeoNet**
Derived for local/regional monitoring, has 100 Hz real-time weak and  200 Hz strong motion. 

- Streams sourced by GeoNet are archived and publicly available in its facilities as IU SNZO.
