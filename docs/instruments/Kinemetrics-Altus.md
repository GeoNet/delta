## Site Aliases

Some initial data was recorded with unregistered station codes, this includes:

```
        "RR#1" => "DECF"
        "RR#2" => "CSBF"
        "FDLS" => "BCOF"
        "RR2"  => "TLED"
        "RR3"  => "COLD"
        "D12C" => "GODS"
        "DCSM" => "DCZ"
        "SECS" => "SECF"
        "JACS" => "JCWJ"
        "RR5"  => "KVSD"
        "D11C" => "PARS"
```

## Slate recording

At some national network sites where a KMI Episensor was connected to a Quanterra Q330
a KMI slate could be installed to both archive a data feed but also act as a detector
for the strong motion feed.  The data was digitised on the Q330 and would retain the
response as configured for the Q330. The resultant EVT file generated by the slate
will have the serial number of the slate in its file description.

The recorded channels will be in order of "Z", "N", "E" as configured on the Q330.
