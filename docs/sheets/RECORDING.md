The dataloggers and recorders produce waveform data that is tagged by recording __station__ code,
recording __site__ code, a "stream" code indicating orientation, and a sampling rate.
The __install__ files are used to map this combination back to actual sensors and dataloggers and their
configurations.

Installed __sensors__ and __recorders__ have their installation times and orientations described in the
__install/sensors.csv__ and __install/recorders.csv__ files respectively.
Deployed __dataloggers__ are described in the __install/dataloggers.csv__ file.

Attaching sensors to dataloggers is managed through linking the __install/connections.csv__ file
to the __install/dataloggers.csv__ file. This is not required for __recorders__ as these are assumed
to be part of the sensor being installed at a recording __site__.
Linking is done via matching a datalogger to a notional "place", and optional operational "role". These
are presently not constrained, other than that they should match when a connection is needed.

Datalogger configuration, through the __install/streams.csv__ file, is meant to provide a mechanism
for mapping recorded data to a datalogger or recorder configuration. This is an overlay
template which isn't dependent on the actual equipment being installed, only the broad settings.
This is also the mechanism that can inject external information, such as when a stream has
been flagged as being of the reverse polarity, and is mainly used to build _StationXML_ meta-data files.

New stations will require a station "code" to be assigned using the appropriate mechanism.

It is intended that recording __stations__ be fixed, any adjustments will be applied retrospectively.
The operation time should span all installations at the __station__.

New recording __sites__ will require a location "code" to be assigned using the appropriate mechanism.
There is a convention used for __location__ codes related to the type of signal being recorded:

* 1X -- weak motion sensors
* 2X -- strong motion sensors
* 3X -- acoustic sensors
* 4X -- pressure sensors
* 5X -- geomagnetic sensors
* 6X -- displacement sensors
* 7X -- weather style measurements
* 8X -- temperature sensors
* 9X -- tilt sensors

Each __site__ location must be different at a given __station__, although there is some leeway
when installing the actual sensor, such as depth down a borehole.

It is intended that recording __sites__ be fixed, any adjustments will be applied retrospectively.

Recorders are managed as a __sensor__ and __datalogger__ pair.
They are installed and removed at the same times and can only be
installed at a single recording __site__. This places a constraint
that there can only be one __sensor__ attached to the __recorder__.

Attaching sensors to dataloggers is managed through linking the __install/connections.csv__ file
to the __install/dataloggers.csv__ file. These are linked by using a notional datalogger "place" and
an optional "role". The "role" can be used to distinguish the datalogger functions when there are more
than one at a given "place". This linkage can be thought of as representing the "sensor cable", ignoring
physical constraints, such as plugs, this link will be independent of that actual datalogger or sensor.

Building the meta-data associated with recorded data requires some general datalogger or recorder configuration information.
This is generally independent of the actual datalogger or sensor used and can span multiple installations.

This information is meant to be used to build a response for a given set of recordings, rather than to define what
data is expected or available.

Use an end date of `9999-01-01T00:00:00Z` to indicate that a streams is currently operational.
