## DOCS

In this folder is documentation describing naming, relations and conventions used to describe and model GeoNet sensor network metadata. Those metadata conventions cover various types of GeoNet data produced by the GeoNet sensor network. 

Each piece of documentation is written with the technical end user in mind, though should also be accessible to the interested layperson.

Many of GeoNet's metadata conventions are derived from international standards or via internal processes which draw inspiration from such standards.

While these documents do not describe how to navigate the *delta* repository, they make reference to some of its files which may prove useful.

Mostly, these documents should be read by the data user looking to better understand GeoNet data and the metadata that describes it and to understand the possible influences of equipment changes on that data.

To easily access metadata in a domain specific format please refer to our website.
