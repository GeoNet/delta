#### _CITATIONS_ ####

A list of _reference_ citations to datasets, publications or otherwise published information.
All fields, other than Key, are optional and can be left blank.
GeoNet hosts a number of datasets that have a DOI assigned. Datasets DOIs are assigned based on data domain and processing level (i.e. raw , derived, etc).

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Key_ | The citation key used where appropriate
| _Author_ | Reference author or authors in a natural format
| _Year_ | Reference year, if appropriate
| _Title_ | The title of the reference in a natural format
| _Published_ | Where reference was published if appropriate and known
| _Volume_ | Series information for published reference if relavent
| _Pages_ | Optional page information for the published reference
| _DOI_ | The reference DOI (_Digital Object Identifier_) if known
| _Link_ | A URL link to the reference if available
| _Retrieved_ | The last time a valid URL was retrieved

#### _DATASETS_ ####
List of domains in relation to sensor network codes and associated datasets citations. 
For the same domain, Datasets with different level of derivation can exist. This is described in the associated citation and DOI reference.  For some datasets, the derived timeseries is available via the Tilde application.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Domain_ | The data domain. This is a concept used by the Tilde data appication, and refers to the broad collection method or data discipline
| _Network_ | Code used to group stations together by sensor domain and project or operator
| _Key_ | The _Citation_ key used where appropriate
| _Tilde_ | Wheter the dataset is available via Tilde data application in a derived form. A Boolean value [`true` or `false`].

#### _DOMAINS_ ####
List of data domains.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Domain_ | The data domain. This is a concept used by the Tilde data application, and refers to the broad collection method or data discipline
| _Description_ | Short description of the domain as used in Tilde application.


#### _METHODS_ ####
The range of methods used in the Tilde application is diverse. In some cases, the details of a method are well
known only to those familiar with a data set or with a similar data set from another institution.
This does not make it easy for non-specialists to use the data.

A list of methods used to collect the data is provided that contains a brief description of the method, and where available, a URL
link to publicly available resources that provide additional information.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Domain_ | The data domain. This is a concept used by the Tilde data appication, and refers to the broad collection method or data discipline |
| _Method_ | The data collection method. How the data are sampled, collected, processed, or analysed |
| _Description_ | A brief description of the data collection method |
| _Reference_ | A publicly available URL that provides additional information on the method |
